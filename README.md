# erasinator-2018
Whiteboard Erasing Robot

## Setup
To build and compile this project, you must have the Arduino IDE installed and 
the Teensyduino application from PCRC. This is necessary as we deploy and 
build on a Teensy 3.2 and use the included Encoder library. The Teensyduino 
installer installs not only the loader for the Arduino IDE but also libraries
and platform definitions for the IDE

Other dependencies for the project can be found in the libraries folder. 
To setup the libraries for your environment, either install the libaries via
the Arduino Library Manager or copy the dependencies into your libraries 
folder as appropriate for your enviroment/platform

# erasinator-2018
Whiteboard Erasing Robot

## Setup
To build and compile this project, you must have the Arduino IDE installed and 
the Teensyduino application from Pololu. This is necessary as we deploy and 
build on a Teensy 3.2 and use motor encoders from Pololu. The Teensyduino 
installer installs not only the loader for the Arduino IDE but also libraries
and platform definitions for the IDE

Other dependencies for the project can be found in the libraries folder.
